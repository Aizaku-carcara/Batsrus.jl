This part will later be separated out for potential Python and Matlab users. Currently the plotting and interpolation needed during plotting are done in Python. For instance, the 3D scatterred interpolation is done via Interpolate in Scipy. Hopefully these additional dependencies will be cut down.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/guide/#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"The VTK files does not have timestep information.

It was a pain at first due to the lack of examples and documents using any basic function like read/read!, but fortunately I figured them out myself. One trick in reading binary array data is the usage of view, or subarrays, in Julia. In order to achieve that, I have to implement my own read! function in addition to the base ones.\nTecplot and VTK unstructured data formats have the same connectivity ordering for hexahedron, but different ordering for voxel (in VTK). A function swaprows is implemented to switch the orderings.\nBecause of the embarrassing parallelism nature of postprocessing, it is quite easy to take advantage of parallel approaches to process the data.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/guide/#Support-for-more-complicated-grid-structures-1","page":"Guide","title":"Support for more complicated grid structures","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"man/guide/#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"For the plotting, streamline tracing and particle tracing, a common problem is the grid and related interpolation process.

The reason is simply using read or unsafe_read in the lower level. The latter one is much faster. After the fix, Julia version performs 5 times faster than the Matlab version in reading binary data.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/guide/#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"In the roadmap of PyCall 2.0, there will direct support for accessing Julia objects.
