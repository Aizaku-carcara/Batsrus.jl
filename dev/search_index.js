This part will later be separated out for potential Python and Matlab users. Currently the plotting and interpolation needed during plotting are done in Python. For instance, the 3D scatterred interpolation is done via Interpolate in Scipy. Hopefully these additional dependencies will be cut down.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/guide/#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"The VTK files does not have timestep information.

It was a pain at first due to the lack of examples and documents using any basic function like read/read!, but fortunately I figured them out myself. One trick in reading binary array data is the usage of view, or subarrays, in Julia. In order to achieve that, I have to implement my own read! function in addition to the base ones.\nTecplot and VTK unstructured data formats have the same connectivity ordering for hexahedron, but different ordering for voxel (in VTK). A function swaprows is implemented to switch the orderings.\nBecause of the embarrassing parallelism nature of postprocessing, it is quite easy to take advantage of parallel approaches to process the data.\nThe built-in streamline function of Matplotlib is not proper for scientifically visualizing field information. The solution is to trace field lines with ODEs and plot the line series, similar to what has been done by Spacepy.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/guide/#Streamline-Tracing-1","page":"Guide","title":"Streamline Tracing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"man/guide/#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"2D streamline tracing is almost finished. 3D streamline tracing is on the way.
